That is, in your desktop environment. This will make {\itshape actual windows pop up}, with stuff in them\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install opener -g

opener http://google.com
opener ./my-file.txt
opener firefox
opener npm run lint
\end{DoxyCode}


Also if you want to use it programmatically you can do that too\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var opener = require("opener");

opener("http://google.com");
opener("./my-file.txt");
opener("firefox");
opener("npm run lint");
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Use It for Good}

Like opening the user\textquotesingle{}s browser with a test harness in your package\textquotesingle{}s test script\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\{
    "scripts": \{
        "test": "opener ./test/runner.html"
    \},
    "devDependencies": \{
        "opener": "*"
    \}
\}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Why}

Because Windows has {\ttfamily start}, Macs have {\ttfamily open}, and $\ast$nix has {\ttfamily xdg-\/open}. At least \href{http://stackoverflow.com/q/1480971/3191}{\tt according to some guy on Stack\+Overflow}. And I like things that work on all three. Like Node.\+js. And Opener.
