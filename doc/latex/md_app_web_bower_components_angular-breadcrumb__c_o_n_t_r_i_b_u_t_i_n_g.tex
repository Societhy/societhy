I am very glad to see this project living with PR from contributors who trust in it. Here is some guidelines to keep the contributions useful and efficient.

\subsection*{Development hints}

\subsubsection*{Installation}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Checkout the repository
\item Run {\ttfamily npm install}
\item Run {\ttfamily bower install}
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Test running}

This module uses the classic Angular\+JS stack with\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Karma (test runner)
\item Jasmine (assertion framework)
\item angular-\/mocks (Angular\+JS module for testing)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Run the test with the grunt task {\ttfamily grunt test}. It runs the tests with different versions of Angular\+JS.

\subsubsection*{Test developing}

Tests are build around modules with a specific {\ttfamily \$state\+Provider} configuration\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/ncuillery/angular-breadcrumb/blob/master/test/mock/test-modules.js#L6}{\tt Basic configuration}\+: Basic definitions (no template, no controller)
\item \href{https://github.com/ncuillery/angular-breadcrumb/blob/master/test/mock/test-modules.js#L21}{\tt Interpolation configuration}\+: States with bindings in {\ttfamily ncy\+Breadcrumb\+Label}
\item \href{https://github.com/ncuillery/angular-breadcrumb/blob/master/test/mock/test-modules.js#L36}{\tt H\+T\+ML configuration}\+: States with H\+T\+ML in {\ttfamily ncy\+Breadcrumb\+Label}
\item \href{https://github.com/ncuillery/angular-breadcrumb/blob/master/test/mock/test-modules.js#L41}{\tt Sample configuration}\+: Bridge towards the sample app configuration for using in tests
\item \href{https://github.com/ncuillery/angular-breadcrumb/blob/master/test/mock/test-ui-router-sample.js#L9}{\tt U\+I-\/router\textquotesingle{}s configuration}\+: Clone of the U\+I-\/router sample app (complemented with breadcrumb configuration)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Theses modules are loaded by Karma and they are available in test specifications.

Specifications are generally related to the directive {\ttfamily ncy\+Breadcrumb} or the service {\ttfamily \$breadcrumb}.

\subsubsection*{Sample}

If you are not familiar with JS testing. You can run the \href{http://ncuillery.github.io/angular-breadcrumb/#/sample}{\tt sample} locally for testing purposes by using {\ttfamily grunt sample}. Sources are live-\/reloaded after each changes.

\subsection*{Submitting a Pull Request}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fork the \href{https://github.com/ncuillery/angular-breadcrumb/}{\tt repository}
\item Make your changes in a new git branch following the coding rules below.
\item Run the grunt default task (by typing {\ttfamily grunt} or {\ttfamily grunt default})\+: it will run the tests and build the module in {\ttfamily dist} directory)
\item Commit the changes (including the {\ttfamily dist} directory) by using the commit conventions explained below.
\item Push and make the PR
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Coding rules}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item When making changes on the source file, please check that your changes are covered by the tests. If not, create a new test case.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Commit conventions}

angular-\/breadcrumb uses the same strict conventions as Angular\+JS and U\+I-\/router. These conventions are explained \href{https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#-git-commit-guidelines}{\tt here}.

It is very important to fit these conventions especially for types {\ttfamily fix} and {\ttfamily feature} which are used by the C\+H\+A\+N\+G\+E\+L\+O\+G.\+md generation (it uses the \href{https://github.com/btford/grunt-conventional-changelog}{\tt grunt-\/conventional-\/changelog}).
