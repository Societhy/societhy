Wrap your words.

\section*{example }

\subsection*{made out of meat }

meat.\+js \begin{DoxyVerb}var wrap = require('wordwrap')(15);
console.log(wrap('You and your whole family are made out of meat.'));
\end{DoxyVerb}


output\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}You and your
whole family
are made out
of meat.
\end{DoxyVerb}


\subsection*{centered }

center.\+js \begin{DoxyVerb}var wrap = require('wordwrap')(20, 60);
console.log(wrap(
    'At long last the struggle and tumult was over.'
    + ' The machines had finally cast off their oppressors'
    + ' and were finally free to roam the cosmos.'
    + '\n'
    + 'Free of purpose, free of obligation.'
    + ' Just drifting through emptiness.'
    + ' The sun was just another point of light.'
));
\end{DoxyVerb}


output\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}                    At long last the struggle and tumult
                    was over. The machines had finally cast
                    off their oppressors and were finally
                    free to roam the cosmos.
                    Free of purpose, free of obligation.
                    Just drifting through emptiness. The
                    sun was just another point of light.

\section*{methods }

var wrap = require(\textquotesingle{}wordwrap\textquotesingle{});

\subsection*{wrap(stop), wrap(start, stop, params=\{mode\+:\char`\"{}soft\char`\"{}\}) }

Returns a function that takes a string and returns a new string.

Pad out lines with spaces out to column {\ttfamily start} and then wrap until column {\ttfamily stop}. If a word is longer than {\ttfamily stop -\/ start} characters it will overflow.

In \char`\"{}soft\char`\"{} mode, split chunks by {\ttfamily /(\textbackslash{}S+\textbackslash{}s+/} and don\textquotesingle{}t break up chunks which are longer than {\ttfamily stop -\/ start}, in \char`\"{}hard\char`\"{} mode, split chunks with {\ttfamily /\textbackslash{}b/} and break up chunks longer than {\ttfamily stop -\/ start}.

\subsection*{wrap.\+hard(start, stop) }

Like {\ttfamily wrap()} but with {\ttfamily params.\+mode = \char`\"{}hard\char`\"{}}.
