Creates a duplex stream

Taken from \href{https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream#duplex-writestream-readstream}{\tt event-\/stream}

\subsection*{duplex (write\+Stream, read\+Stream)}

Takes a writable stream and a readable stream and makes them appear as a readable writable stream.

It is assumed that the two streams are connected to each other in some way.

var grep = cp.exec('grep Stream')

duplex(grep.stdin, grep.stdout)
\end{DoxyCode}
