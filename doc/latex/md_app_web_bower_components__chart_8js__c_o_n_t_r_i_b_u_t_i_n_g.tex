Contributions to Chart.\+js are welcome and encouraged, but please have a look through the guidelines in this document before raising an issue, or writing code for the project.

\subsection*{Using issues }

The \href{https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/issues}{\tt issue tracker} is the preferred channel for reporting bugs, requesting new features and submitting pull requests.

If you\textquotesingle{}re suggesting a new chart type, please take a look at \href{https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/06-Advanced.md#writing-new-chart-types}{\tt writing new chart types} in the documentation, and some of the \href{https://github.com/nnnick/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/06-Advanced.md#community-extensions}{\tt community extensions} that have been created already.

To keep the library lightweight for everyone, it\textquotesingle{}s unlikely we\textquotesingle{}ll add many more chart types to the core of Chart.\+js, but issues are a good medium to design and spec out how new chart types could work and look.

Please do not use issues for support requests. For help using Chart.\+js, please take a look at the \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/chartjs}{\tt {\ttfamily chartjs}} tag on Stack Overflow.

\subsection*{Reporting bugs }

Well structured, detailed bug reports are hugely valuable for the project.

Guidlines for reporting bugs\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Check the issue search to see if it has already been reported
\item Isolate the problem to a simple test case
\item Provide a demonstration of the problem on \href{http://jsbin.com}{\tt JS Bin} or similar
\end{DoxyItemize}

Please provide any additional details associated with the bug, if it\textquotesingle{}s browser or screen density specific, or only happens with a certain configuration or data.

\subsection*{Pull requests }

Clear, concise pull requests are excellent at continuing the project\textquotesingle{}s community driven growth. But please review \href{https://github.com/blog/1943-how-to-write-the-perfect-pull-request}{\tt these guidelines} and the guidelines below before starting work on the project.
