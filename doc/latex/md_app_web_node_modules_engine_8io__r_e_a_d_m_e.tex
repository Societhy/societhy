{\ttfamily Engine.\+IO} is the implementation of transport-\/based cross-\/browser/cross-\/device bi-\/directional communication layer for \href{http://github.com/socketio/socket.io}{\tt Socket.\+IO}.

\subsection*{How to use}

\subsubsection*{Server}

\paragraph*{(A) Listening on a port}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var engine = require('engine.io');
var server = engine.listen(80);

server.on('connection', function(socket)\{
  socket.send('utf 8 string');
  socket.send(new Buffer([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // binary data
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


\paragraph*{(B) Intercepting requests for a http.\+Server}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var engine = require('engine.io');
var http = require('http').createServer().listen(3000);
var server = engine.attach(http);

server.on('connection', function (socket) \{
  socket.on('message', function(data)\{ \});
  socket.on('close', function()\{ \});
\});
\end{DoxyCode}


\paragraph*{(C) Passing in requests}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var engine = require('engine.io');

\end{DoxyCode}


Then\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
cd engine.io
npm install
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Tests}

Tests run with {\ttfamily make test}. It runs the server tests that are aided by the usage of {\ttfamily engine.\+io-\/client}.

Make sure {\ttfamily npm install} is run first.

\subsection*{Goals}

The main goal of {\ttfamily Engine} is ensuring the most reliable realtime communication. Unlike the previous Socket.\+IO core, it always establishes a long-\/polling connection first, then tries to upgrade to better transports that are \char`\"{}tested\char`\"{} on the side.

During the lifetime of the Socket.\+IO projects, we\textquotesingle{}ve found countless drawbacks to relying on {\ttfamily H\+T\+M\+L5 Web\+Socket} or {\ttfamily Flash Socket} as the first connection mechanisms.

Both are clearly the {\itshape right way} of establishing a bidirectional communication, with H\+T\+M\+L5 Web\+Socket being the way of the future. However, to answer most business needs, alternative traditional H\+T\+TP 1.\+1 mechanisms are just as good as delivering the same solution.

Web\+Socket based connections have two fundamental benefits\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries Better server performance}
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\itshape A\+: Load balancers}~\newline
 Load balancing a long polling connection poses a serious architectural nightmare since requests can come from any number of open sockets by the user agent, but they all need to be routed to the process and computer that owns the {\ttfamily Engine} connection. This negatively impacts R\+AM and C\+PU usage.
\item {\itshape B\+: Network traffic}~\newline
 Web\+Socket is designed around the premise that each message frame has to be surrounded by the least amount of data. In H\+T\+TP 1.\+1 transports, each message frame is surrounded by H\+T\+TP headers and chunked encoding frames. If you try to send the message \+\_\+\char`\"{}\+Hello world\char`\"{}\+\_\+ with xhr-\/polling, the message ultimately becomes larger than if you were to send it with Web\+Socket.
\item {\itshape C\+: Lightweight parser}~\newline
 As an effect of {\bfseries B}, the server has to do a lot more work to parse the network data and figure out the message when traditional H\+T\+TP requests are used (as in long polling). This means that another advantage of Web\+Socket is less server C\+PU usage.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\bfseries Better user experience}

Due to the reasons stated in point {\bfseries 1}, the most important effect of being able to establish a Web\+Socket connection is raw data transfer speed, which translates in {\itshape some} cases in better user experience.

Applications with heavy realtime interaction (such as games) will benefit greatly, whereas applications like realtime chat (Gmail/\+Facebook), newsfeeds (Facebook) or timelines (Twitter) will have negligible user experience improvements.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Having said this, attempting to establish a Web\+Socket connection directly so far has proven problematic\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item {\bfseries Proxies}~\newline
 Many corporate proxies block Web\+Socket traffic.
\item {\bfseries Personal firewall and antivirus software}~\newline
 As a result of our research, we\textquotesingle{}ve found that at least 3 personal security applications block Web\+Socket traffic.
\item {\bfseries Cloud application platforms}~\newline
 Platforms like Heroku or No.\+de have had trouble keeping up with the fast-\/paced nature of the evolution of the Web\+Socket protocol. Applications therefore end up inevitably using long polling, but the seamless installation experience of Socket.\+IO we strive for (\+\_\+\char`\"{}require() it and it just works\char`\"{}\+\_\+) disappears.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Some of these problems have solutions. In the case of proxies and personal programs, however, the solutions many times involve upgrading software. Experience has shown that relying on client software upgrades to deliver a business solution is fruitless\+: the very existence of this project has to do with a fragmented panorama of user agent distribution, with clients connecting with latest versions of the most modern user agents (Chrome, Firefox and Safari), but others with versions as low as IE 5.\+5.

From the user perspective, an unsuccessful Web\+Socket connection can translate in up to at least 10 seconds of waiting for the realtime application to begin exchanging data. This {\bfseries perceptively} hurts user experience.

To summarize, {\bfseries Engine} focuses on reliability and user experience first, marginal potential UX improvements and increased server performance second. {\ttfamily Engine} is the result of all the lessons learned with Web\+Socket in the wild.

\subsection*{Architecture}

The main premise of {\ttfamily Engine}, and the core of its existence, is the ability to swap transports on the fly. A connection starts as xhr-\/polling, but it can switch to Web\+Socket.

The central problem this poses is\+: how do we switch transports without losing messages?

{\ttfamily Engine} only switches from polling to another transport in between polling cycles. Since the server closes the connection after a certain timeout when there\textquotesingle{}s no activity, and the polling transport implementation buffers messages in between connections, this ensures no message loss and optimal performance.

Another benefit of this design is that we workaround almost all the limitations of {\bfseries Flash Socket}, such as slow connection times, increased file size (we can safely lazy load it without hurting user experience), etc.

\subsection*{F\+AQ}

\subsubsection*{Can I use engine without Socket.\+IO ?}

Absolutely. Although the recommended framework for building realtime applications is Socket.\+IO, since it provides fundamental features for real-\/world applications such as multiplexing, reconnection support, etc.

{\ttfamily Engine} is to Socket.\+IO what Connect is to Express. An essential piece for building realtime frameworks, but something you {\itshape probably} won\textquotesingle{}t be using for building actual applications.

\subsubsection*{Does the server serve the client?}

No. The main reason is that {\ttfamily Engine} is meant to be bundled with frameworks. Socket.\+IO includes {\ttfamily Engine}, therefore serving two clients is not necessary. If you use Socket.\+IO, including


\begin{DoxyCode}
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js">
\end{DoxyCode}


has you covered.

\subsubsection*{Can I implement {\ttfamily Engine} in other languages?}

Absolutely. The \href{https://github.com/LearnBoost/engine.io-protocol}{\tt engine.\+io-\/protocol} repository contains the most up to date description of the specification at all times, and the parser implementation in Java\+Script.
