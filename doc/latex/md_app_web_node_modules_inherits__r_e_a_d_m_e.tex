Browser-\/friendly inheritance fully compatible with standard node.\+js \href{http://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_util_inherits_constructor_superconstructor}{\tt inherits}.

This package exports standard {\ttfamily inherits} from node.\+js {\ttfamily util} module in node environment, but also provides alternative browser-\/friendly implementation through \href{https://gist.github.com/shtylman/4339901}{\tt browser field}. Alternative implementation is a literal copy of standard one located in standalone module to avoid requiring of {\ttfamily util}. It also has a shim for old browsers with no {\ttfamily Object.\+create} support.

While keeping you sure you are using standard {\ttfamily inherits} implementation in node.\+js environment, it allows bundlers such as \href{https://github.com/substack/node-browserify}{\tt browserify} to not include full {\ttfamily util} package to your client code if all you need is just {\ttfamily inherits} function. It worth, because browser shim for {\ttfamily util} package is large and {\ttfamily inherits} is often the single function you need from it.

It\textquotesingle{}s recommended to use this package instead of `require(\textquotesingle{}util\textquotesingle{}).inherits` for any code that has chances to be used not only in node.\+js but in browser too.

\subsection*{usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
var inherits = require('inherits');
// then use exactly as the standard one
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{note on version $\sim$1.0}

Version $\sim$1.0 had completely different motivation and is not compatible neither with 2.\+0 nor with standard node.\+js {\ttfamily inherits}.

If you are using version $\sim$1.0 and planning to switch to $\sim$2.0, be careful\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item new version uses {\ttfamily super\+\_\+} instead of {\ttfamily super} for referencing superclass
\item new version overwrites current prototype while old one preserves any existing fields on it 
\end{DoxyItemize}
