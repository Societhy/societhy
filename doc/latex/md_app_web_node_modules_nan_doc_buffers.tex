N\+AN\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily node\+::\+Buffer} helpers exist as the A\+PI has changed across supported Node versions. Use these methods to ensure compatibility.

\label{_api_nan_new_buffer}%
 \subsubsection*{Nan\+::\+New\+Buffer()}

Allocate a new {\ttfamily node\+::\+Buffer} object with the specified size and optional data. Calls {\ttfamily node\+::\+Buffer\+::\+New()}.

Note that when creating a {\ttfamily Buffer} using {\ttfamily Nan\+::\+New\+Buffer()} and an existing {\ttfamily char$\ast$}, it is assumed that the ownership of the pointer is being transferred to the new {\ttfamily Buffer} for management. When a {\ttfamily node\+::\+Buffer} instance is garbage collected and a {\ttfamily Free\+Callback} has not been specified, {\ttfamily data} will be disposed of via a call to {\ttfamily free()}. You {\itshape must not} free the memory space manually once you have created a {\ttfamily Buffer} in this way.

\label{_api_nan_copy_buffer}%
 \subsubsection*{Nan\+::\+Copy\+Buffer()}

Similar to \href{#api_nan_new_buffer}{\tt {\ttfamily Nan\+::\+New\+Buffer()}} except that an implicit memcpy will occur within Node. Calls {\ttfamily node\+::\+Buffer\+::\+Copy()}.

Management of the {\ttfamily char$\ast$} is left to the user, you should manually free the memory space if necessary as the new {\ttfamily Buffer} will have its own copy.

Signature\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\{c++\}
Nan::MaybeLocal<v8::Object> Nan::CopyBuffer(const char *data, uint32\_t size)
\end{DoxyCode}


\label{_api_nan_free_callback}%
 \subsubsection*{Nan\+::\+Free\+Callback()}

A free callback that can be provided to \href{#api_nan_new_buffer}{\tt {\ttfamily Nan\+::\+New\+Buffer()}}. The supplied callback will be invoked when the {\ttfamily Buffer} undergoes garbage collection.

Signature\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
\{c++\}
typedef void (*FreeCallback)(char *data, void *hint);
