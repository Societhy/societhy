When you want to fire an event no matter how a process exits\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item reaching the end of execution.
\item explicitly having {\ttfamily process.\+exit(code)} called.
\item having {\ttfamily process.\+kill(pid, sig)} called.
\item receiving a fatal signal from outside the process
\end{DoxyItemize}

Use {\ttfamily signal-\/exit}.


\begin{DoxyCode}
var onExit = require('signal-exit')

onExit(function (code, signal) \{
  console.log('process exited!')
\})
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{A\+PI}

{\ttfamily var remove = on\+Exit(function (code, signal) \{\}, options)}

The return value of the function is a function that will remove the handler.

Note that the function {\itshape only} fires for signals if the signal would cause the proces to exit. That is, there are no other listeners, and it is a fatal signal.

\subsection*{Options}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily always\+Last}\+: Run this handler after any other signal or exit handlers. This causes {\ttfamily process.\+emit} to be monkeypatched. 
\end{DoxyItemize}
