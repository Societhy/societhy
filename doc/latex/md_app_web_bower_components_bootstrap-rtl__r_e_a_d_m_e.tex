{\itshape {\bfseries Note\+: Hopefully, they will add rtl support to the next major release of bootstrap, so this project will be absolete. However, it\textquotesingle{}s going to be updated for the next 3.\+x releases.}}

\begin{quote}
Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-\/end framework for faster and easier web development. \end{quote}


Bootstrap R\+TL provides simple yet robust right-\/to-\/left capability for Bootstrap 3, by employing new theming feature of it. Simply put its C\+SS after bootstrap\textquotesingle{}s original C\+SS, to the pages designed by Bootstrap 3. It works just like an extension on top of the original Bootstrap\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap.css">


<link rel="stylesheet" href="bootstrap-rtl.css">
\end{DoxyCode}


Or load it from C\+DN\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//cdn.rawgit.com/morteza/bootstrap-rtl/master/dist/css/bootstrap-rtl.min.css">
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Quick start}

To get started, {\bfseries \href{https://github.com/morteza/bootstrap-rtl/releases/latest}{\tt download latest release}}. Check {\ttfamily examples/} directory for more. It\textquotesingle{}s just like Bootstrap 3, nothing special. You can also install it via bower\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Run {\ttfamily bower install bootstrap-\/rtl} and latest version will be installed under {\itshape bower\+\_\+components/bootstrap-\/rtl/} directory.
\end{DoxyItemize}

In addition to bootstrap distribution, L\+E\+SS codes for R\+TL theme and compiled C\+SS ({\ttfamily bootstrap-\/rtl.\+css}) are provided, as well as minified C\+SS ({\ttfamily bootstrap-\/rtl.\+min.\+css}). Check {\ttfamily dist/} directory for all the codes you need.

\paragraph*{Auto Flip ({\ttfamily .flip})}

To automatically flip placements from right to left and vice versa (in bilingual pages), use {\ttfamily .flip} alongside {\ttfamily .pull-\/right} and {\ttfamily .pull-\/left}. This is a custom class and is not available in the original Bootstrap 3.

\subsection*{Building C\+SS and Java\+Script}

Bootstrap R\+TL uses \href{http://gruntjs.com/}{\tt Grunt} for working with the framework. Follow these simple steps to prepare and compile\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Run {\ttfamily npm install} to download and prepare dependencies.
\item Run {\ttfamily grunt}, and check {\ttfamily dist/} directory for outputs.
\end{DoxyEnumerate}
