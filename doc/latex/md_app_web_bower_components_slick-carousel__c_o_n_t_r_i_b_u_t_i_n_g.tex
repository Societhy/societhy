\subsubsection*{Test case required}

{\bfseries All bug reports and problem issues require a js\+Fiddle}. \href{http://jsfiddle.net/simeydotme/fmo50w7n/}{\tt Please fork this J\+S\+Fiddle as a baseline}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A test case clearly demonstrates the bug or issue.
\item It contains the bare minimum H\+T\+ML, C\+SS, and Java\+Script required to demonstrate the bug.
\item Assets are not minified (we cannot debug .min.\+js files).
\item A link to your production site is {\bfseries not} a reduced test case.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Providing a test case is the best way to get your issue addressed. Without a test case; your issue may be closed. You must provide a clear and simple way to reproduce the issue with the provided fiddle.

\subsection*{Support}

Although Slick is designed to be super easy to use, there\textquotesingle{}s always things that can go wrong, especially when interacting with other plugins and complicated websites. If you are {\bfseries having problems getting Slick to work}, or can\textquotesingle{}t figure something out, {\bfseries this repository}\textquotesingle{}s issues section {\bfseries is not the place to ask about it}.

I have set up a subreddit for Slick discussion at \href{http://www.reddit.com/r/slickcarousel/}{\tt reddit.\+com/r/slickcarousel}. And a gitter chatroom here\+: \href{https://gitter.im/kenwheeler/slick}{\tt gitter.\+im/kenwheeler/slick}. And finally you can ask the world for help, and find out if anyone else has your problem at \href{http://stackoverflow.com/search?q=slick+carousel}{\tt stackoverflow}.

Please use these forums as an area to discuss Slick and any issues you may have.

\subsection*{Feature Requests}

If you would like to request or propose a feature, please do so in the the Slick subreddit or gitter chat\+: \href{http://www.reddit.com/r/slickcarousel/}{\tt reddit.\+com/r/slickcarousel} / \href{https://gitter.im/kenwheeler/slick}{\tt gitter.\+im/kenwheeler/slick}.

\subsection*{Pull requests}

{\bfseries Contributions are welcome}! That said, please {\itshape be prepared to edit} your pull request at request, and provide a js\+Fiddle of your fork working interoperably with every \char`\"{}mode\char`\"{} that Slick supports, and with varying numbers of slides, slides\+To\+Show \& slides\+To\+Scroll. Failure to do so will result in your pull request being closed.

{\itshape Please note that while Slick is open source, this is still my baby, and by submitting a pull request you are authorizing me to edit or modify it in any way shape or form. You will be listed in Github as a contributor, but I have and will continue to steer the direction of this project.}
