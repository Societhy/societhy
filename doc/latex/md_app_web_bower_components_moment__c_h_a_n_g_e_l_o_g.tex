\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{2.\+8.\+0 \href{https://gist.github.com/ichernev/ac3899324a5fa6c8c9b4}{\tt See changelog}}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item incompatible changes
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1761}{\tt \#1761}\+: moments created without a language are no longer following the global language, in case it changes. Only newly created moments take the global language by default. In case you\textquotesingle{}re affected by this, wait, comment on \href{https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1797}{\tt \#1797} and wait for a proper reimplementation
\item \href{https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1642}{\tt \#1642}\+: 45 days is no longer \char`\"{}a month\char`\"{} according to humanize, cutoffs for month, and year have changed. Hopefully your code does not depend on a particular answer from humanize (which it shouldn\textquotesingle{}t anyway)
\item \href{https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1784}{\tt \#1784}\+: if you use the human readable English datetime format in a weird way (like storing them in a database) that would break when the format changes you\textquotesingle{}re at risk.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item deprecations (old behavior will be dropped in 3.\+0)
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1761}{\tt \#1761} {\ttfamily lang} is renamed to {\ttfamily locale}, {\ttfamily lang\+Data} -\/$>$ {\ttfamily locale\+Data}. Also there is now {\ttfamily define\+Locale} that should be used when creating new locales
\item \href{https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1763}{\tt \#1763} {\ttfamily add(unit, value)} and {\ttfamily subtract(unit, value)} are now deprecated. Use {\ttfamily add(value, unit)} and {\ttfamily subtract(value, unit)} instead.
\item \href{https://github.com/moment/moment/issues/1759}{\tt \#1759} rename {\ttfamily duration.\+to\+Iso\+String} to {\ttfamily duration.\+to\+I\+S\+O\+String}. The js standard library and moment\textquotesingle{}s {\ttfamily to\+I\+S\+O\+String} follow that convention.
