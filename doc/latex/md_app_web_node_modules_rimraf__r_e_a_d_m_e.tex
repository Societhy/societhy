{\ttfamily rm -\/rf} for node.

Install with {\ttfamily npm install rimraf}, or just drop rimraf.\+js somewhere.

\subsection*{A\+PI}

{\ttfamily rimraf(f, callback)}

The callback will be called with an error if there is one. Certain errors are handled for you\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Windows\+: {\ttfamily E\+B\+U\+SY} and {\ttfamily E\+N\+O\+T\+E\+M\+P\+TY} -\/ rimraf will back off a maximum of {\ttfamily opts.\+max\+Busy\+Tries} times before giving up.
\item {\ttfamily E\+N\+O\+E\+NT} -\/ If the file doesn\textquotesingle{}t exist, rimraf will return successfully, since your desired outcome is already the case.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{rimraf.\+sync}

It can remove stuff synchronously, too. But that\textquotesingle{}s not so good. Use the async A\+PI. It\textquotesingle{}s better.

\subsection*{C\+LI}

If installed with {\ttfamily npm install rimraf -\/g} it can be used as a global command {\ttfamily rimraf $<$path$>$} which is useful for cross platform support.

\subsection*{mkdirp}
