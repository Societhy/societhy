\subsection*{How to use}

A standalone build of {\ttfamily socket.\+io-\/client} is exposed automatically by the socket.\+io server as {\ttfamily /socket.io/socket.\+io.\+js}. Alternatively you can serve the file {\ttfamily socket.\+io.\+js} or {\ttfamily socket.\+io.\+min.\+js} found in the {\ttfamily dist} folder.


\begin{DoxyCode}
<script src="/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = io('http://localhost');
  socket.on('connect', function()\{\});
  socket.on('event', function(data)\{\});
  socket.on('disconnect', function()\{\});
</script>
\end{DoxyCode}


Socket.\+IO is compatible with \href{http://browserify.org/}{\tt browserify}.

\subsubsection*{Node.\+JS (server-\/side usage)}

Add {\ttfamily socket.\+io-\/client} to your {\ttfamily package.\+json} and then\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
var socket = require('socket.io-client')('http://localhost');
socket.on('connect', function()\{\});
socket.on('event', function(data)\{\});
socket.on('disconnect', function()\{\});
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{A\+PI}

\subsubsection*{I\+O(url\+:\+String, opts\+:\+Object)\+:Socket}

Exposed as the {\ttfamily io} namespace in the standalone build, or the result of calling `require(\textquotesingle{}socket.\+io-\/client\textquotesingle{})`.

When called, it creates a new {\ttfamily Manager} for the given U\+RL, and attempts to reuse an existing {\ttfamily Manager} for subsequent calls, unless the {\ttfamily multiplex} option is passed with {\ttfamily false}.

The rest of the options are passed to the {\ttfamily Manager} constructor (see below for details).

A {\ttfamily Socket} instance is returned for the namespace specified by the pathname in the U\+RL, defaulting to {\ttfamily /}. For example, if the {\ttfamily url} is {\ttfamily \href{http://localhost/users}{\tt http\+://localhost/users}}, a transport connection will be established to {\ttfamily \href{http://localhost}{\tt http\+://localhost}} and a Socket.\+IO connection will be established to {\ttfamily /users}.

\subsubsection*{I\+O\+::protocol}

Socket.\+io protocol revision number this client works with.

\subsubsection*{I\+O\+::\+Socket}

Reference to the {\ttfamily Socket} constructor.

\subsubsection*{I\+O\+::\+Manager}

Reference to the {\ttfamily Manager} constructor.

\subsubsection*{I\+O\+::\+Emitter}

Reference to the {\ttfamily Emitter} constructor.

\subsubsection*{Manager(url\+:\+String, opts\+:\+Object)}

A {\ttfamily Manager} represents a connection to a given Socket.\+IO server. One or more {\ttfamily Socket} instances are associated with the manager. The manager can be accessed through the {\ttfamily io} property of each {\ttfamily Socket} instance.

The {\ttfamily opts} are also passed to {\ttfamily engine.\+io} upon initialization of the underlying {\ttfamily Socket}.

Options\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily reconnection} whether to reconnect automatically ({\ttfamily true})
\item {\ttfamily reconnection\+Attempts} ({\ttfamily Infinity}) before giving up
\item {\ttfamily reconnection\+Delay} how long to initially wait before attempting a new reconnection ({\ttfamily 1000}). Affected by +/-\/ {\ttfamily randomization\+Factor}, for example the default initial delay will be between 500 to 1500ms.
\item {\ttfamily reconnection\+Delay\+Max} maximum amount of time to wait between reconnections ({\ttfamily 5000}). Each attempt increases the reconnection delay by 2x along with a randomization as above
\item {\ttfamily randomization\+Factor} ({\ttfamily 0.\+5}), 0 $<$= randomization\+Factor $<$= 1
\item {\ttfamily timeout} connection timeout before a {\ttfamily connect\+\_\+error} and {\ttfamily connect\+\_\+timeout} events are emitted ({\ttfamily 20000})
\item {\ttfamily auto\+Connect} by setting this false, you have to call {\ttfamily manager.\+open} whenever you decide it\textquotesingle{}s appropriate
\end{DoxyItemize}

\paragraph*{Events}


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily connect\+\_\+error}. Fired upon a connection error. Parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Object} error object
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily connect\+\_\+timeout}. Fired upon a connection timeout.
\item {\ttfamily reconnect}. Fired upon a successful reconnection. Parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Number} reconnection attempt number
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily reconnect\+\_\+attempt}. Fired upon an attempt to reconnect.
\item {\ttfamily reconnecting}. Fired upon an attempt to reconnect. Parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Number} reconnection attempt number
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily reconnect\+\_\+error}. Fired upon a reconnection attempt error. Parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Object} error object
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily reconnect\+\_\+failed}. Fired when couldn\textquotesingle{}t reconnect within {\ttfamily reconnection\+Attempts}
\item {\ttfamily ping}. Fired when a ping packet is written out to the server.
\item {\ttfamily pong}. Fired when a pong is received from the server. Parameters\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily Number} number of ms elapsed since {\ttfamily ping} packet (i.\+e.\+: latency).
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

The events above are also emitted on the individual sockets that reconnect that depend on this {\ttfamily Manager}.

\subsubsection*{Manager\+::reconnection(v\+:\+Boolean)\+:Manager}

Sets the {\ttfamily reconnection} option, or returns it if no parameters are passed.

\subsubsection*{Manager\+::reconnection\+Attempts(v\+:\+Boolean)\+:Manager}

Sets the {\ttfamily reconnection\+Attempts} option, or returns it if no parameters are passed.

\subsubsection*{Manager\+::reconnection\+Delay(v\+:\+Boolean)\+:Manager}

Sets the {\ttfamily reconection\+Delay} option, or returns it if no parameters are passed.

\subsubsection*{Manager\+::reconnection\+Delay\+Max(v\+:\+Boolean)\+:Manager}

Sets the {\ttfamily reconection\+Delay\+Max} option, or returns it if no parameters are passed.

\subsubsection*{Manager\+::timeout(v\+:\+Boolean)\+:Manager}

Sets the {\ttfamily timeout} option, or returns it if no parameters are passed.

\subsubsection*{Socket}

\paragraph*{Socket\+::id\+:String}

A property on the {\ttfamily socket} instance that is equal to the underlying engine.\+io socket id.

The property is present once the socket has connected, is removed when the socket disconnects and is updated if the socket reconnects.

\paragraph*{Socket\+::compress(v\+:\+Boolean)\+:Socket}

Sets a modifier for a subsequent event emission that the event data will only be {\itshape compressed} if the value is {\ttfamily true}. Defaults to {\ttfamily true} when you don\textquotesingle{}t call the method.


\begin{DoxyCode}
socket.compress(false).emit('an event', \{ some: 'data' \});
\end{DoxyCode}

\item {\ttfamily connect}. Fired upon a connection including a successful reconnection.
