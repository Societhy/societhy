\section*{Original R\+E\+A\+D\+ME}

node-\/\+X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request is a wrapper for the built-\/in http client to emulate the browser X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request object.

This can be used with JS designed for browsers to improve reuse of code and allow the use of existing libraries.

Note\+: This library currently conforms to \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest/}{\tt X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request 1}. Version 2.\+0 will target \href{http://www.w3.org/TR/XMLHttpRequest2/}{\tt X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request Level 2}.

\subsection*{Usage}

Here\textquotesingle{}s how to include the module in your project and use as the browser-\/based X\+HR object. \begin{DoxyVerb}var XMLHttpRequest = require("xmlhttprequest").XMLHttpRequest;
var xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
\end{DoxyVerb}


Note\+: use the lowercase string \char`\"{}xmlhttprequest\char`\"{} in your require(). On case-\/sensitive systems (eg Linux) using uppercase letters won\textquotesingle{}t work.

\subsection*{Versions}

Prior to 1.\+4.\+0 version numbers were arbitrary. From 1.\+4.\+0 on they conform to the standard major.\+minor.\+bugfix. 1.\+x shouldn\textquotesingle{}t necessarily be considered stable just because it\textquotesingle{}s above 0.\+x.

Since the X\+M\+L\+Http\+Request A\+PI is stable this library\textquotesingle{}s A\+PI is stable as well. Major version numbers indicate significant core code changes. Minor versions indicate minor core code changes or better conformity to the W3C spec.

\subsection*{Known Issues / Missing Features}

For a list of open issues or to report your own visit the \href{https://github.com/driverdan/node-XMLHttpRequest/issues}{\tt github issues page}.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Local file access may have unexpected results for non-\/\+U\+T\+F8 files
\item Synchronous requests don\textquotesingle{}t set headers properly
\item Synchronous requests freeze node while waiting for response (But that\textquotesingle{}s what you want, right? Stick with async!).
\item Some events are missing, such as abort
\item get\+Request\+Header is case-\/sensitive
\item Cookies aren\textquotesingle{}t persisted between requests
\item Missing X\+ML support
\item Missing basic auth
