Check if a path exists \end{quote}


Because \href{https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_exists_path_callback}{\tt {\ttfamily fs.\+exists()}} is being \href{https://github.com/iojs/io.js/issues/103}{\tt deprecated}, but there\textquotesingle{}s still a genuine use-\/case of being able to check if a path exists for other purposes than doing IO with it.

Never use this before handling a file though\+:

\begin{quote}
In particular, checking if a file exists before opening it is an anti-\/pattern that leaves you vulnerable to race conditions\+: another process may remove the file between the calls to {\ttfamily fs.\+exists()} and {\ttfamily fs.\+open()}. Just open the file and handle the error when it\textquotesingle{}s not there. \end{quote}
