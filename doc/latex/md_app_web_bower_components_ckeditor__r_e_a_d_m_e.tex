\subsection*{Releases Code}

This repository contains the official release versions of \href{http://ckeditor.com}{\tt C\+K\+Editor}.

There are four versions for each release --- {\ttfamily standard-\/all}, {\ttfamily basic}, {\ttfamily standard}, and {\ttfamily full}. They differ in the number of plugins that are compiled into the main {\ttfamily ckeditor.\+js} file as well as the toolbar configuration.

See the \href{http://ckeditor.com/presets}{\tt comparison} of the {\ttfamily basic}, {\ttfamily standard}, and {\ttfamily full} installation presets for more details.

The {\ttfamily standard-\/all} build includes all official C\+K\+Source plugins with only those from the {\ttfamily standard} installation preset compiled into the {\ttfamily ckeditor.\+js} file and enabled in the configuration.

All versions available in this repository were built using \href{http://ckeditor.com/builder}{\tt C\+K\+Builder}, so they are optimized and ready to be used in a production environment.
