\#\# Installing via Bower 
\begin{DoxyCode}
bower install ng-table
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Development}

We use Karma to ensure the quality of the code. The easiest way to run these checks is to use grunt\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install && bower install
grunt
\end{DoxyCode}


The karma task will try to open Firefox and Chrome as browser in which to run the tests. Make sure this is available or change the configuration in {\ttfamily karma.\+conf.\+js}

\subsection*{Configuring ng-\/table}

For a list of configuration options available, see \href{https://github.com/esvit/ng-table/wiki/Configuring-your-table-with-ngTableParams}{\tt Configuring your table with Ng\+Table\+Params}

\subsection*{Updates}

\subsection*{Submitting an issue}

Please be responsible, the open source community is not there to guess your problem or to do your job. When submitting an issue try as much as possible to\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item search in the already existing issues or on \href{http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ngtable?sort=newest&pageSize=30}{\tt stackoverflow} if your issue has not been raised before.
\item give a precise description mentionning angular version, ng-\/table version.
\item give a way to reproduce your issue, the best would be with a {\bfseries running example}, you can use \href{http://plnkr.co/}{\tt plunkr}, or \href{http://codepen.io/}{\tt codepen}. {\bfseries Tip\+:} See below for a list of base codepen\textquotesingle{}s you can fork
\item isolate your code sample on the probable issue to avoid pollution and noise.
\item Close your issue when a solution has been found (and share it with the community)
\end{DoxyEnumerate}

Note that 80\% of the open issues are actually not issues but \char`\"{}problem\char`\"{} due to developpers laziness or lack of investigation. These \char`\"{}issues\char`\"{} are a waste of time for us and especially if we have to setup a sample to reproduce the issue which those developpers could have done. Any open issue which does not fulfill this contract will be closed without investigation.
