\section*{v1.\+3.\+0}

New Features\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily constant}
\item Added {\ttfamily asyncify}/{\ttfamily wrap\+Sync} for making sync functions work with callbacks. (\#671, \#806)
\item Added {\ttfamily during} and {\ttfamily do\+During}, which are like {\ttfamily whilst} with an async truth test. (\#800)
\item {\ttfamily retry} now accepts an {\ttfamily interval} parameter to specify a delay between retries. (\#793)
\item {\ttfamily async} should work better in Web Workers due to better {\ttfamily root} detection (\#804)

\item Various internal updates (\#786, \#801, \#802, \#803)
\item Various doc fixes (\#790, \#794)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Bug Fixes\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}

\section*{v1.\+2.\+1}

Bug Fix\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Small regression with synchronous iterator behavior in {\ttfamily each\+Series} with a 1-\/element array. Before 1.\+1.\+0, {\ttfamily each\+Series}\textquotesingle{}s callback was called on the same tick, which this patch restores. In 2.\+0.\+0, it will be called on the next tick. (\#782)
\end{DoxyItemize}

\section*{v1.\+2.\+0}

New Features\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Added {\ttfamily times\+Limit} (\#743)
\item {\ttfamily concurrency} can be changed after initialization in {\ttfamily queue} by setting {\ttfamily q.\+concurrency}. The new concurrency will be reflected the next time a task is processed. (\#747, \#772)
\end{DoxyItemize}

Bug Fixes\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Fixed a regression in {\ttfamily each} and family with empty arrays that have additional properties. (\#775, \#777)

\section*{v1.\+1.\+1}

Bug Fix\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Small regression with synchronous iterator behavior in {\ttfamily each\+Series} with a 1-\/element array. Before 1.\+1.\+0, {\ttfamily each\+Series}\textquotesingle{}s callback was called on the same tick, which this patch restores. In 2.\+0.\+0, it will be called on the next tick. (\#782)

New Features\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily cargo} now supports all of the same methods and event callbacks as {\ttfamily queue}.

\item Optimized {\ttfamily map}, {\ttfamily each\+Of}, and {\ttfamily waterfall} families of functions
\item Passing a {\ttfamily null} or {\ttfamily undefined} array to {\ttfamily map}, {\ttfamily each}, {\ttfamily parallel} and families will be treated as an empty array (\#667).
\item The callback is now optional for the composed results of {\ttfamily compose} and {\ttfamily seq}. (\#618)
\item Reduced file size by 4kb, (minified version by 1kb)
\item Added code coverage through {\ttfamily nyc} and {\ttfamily coveralls} (\#768)

\item Doc fixes (\#629, \#766)
