\end{DoxyItemize}

Modernizr tests which native C\+S\+S3 and H\+T\+M\+L5 features are available in the current UA and makes the results available to you in two ways\+: as properties on a global {\ttfamily Modernizr} object, and as classes on the {\ttfamily $<$html$>$} element. This information allows you to progressively enhance your pages with a granular level of control over the experience.

Modernizr has an optional ({\itshape not included}) conditional resource loader called {\ttfamily Modernizr.\+load()}, based on \href{http://yepnopejs.com}{\tt Yepnope.\+js}. You can get a build that includes {\ttfamily Modernizr.\+load()}, as well as choosing which feature tests to include on the \href{http://www.modernizr.com/download/}{\tt Download page}.
