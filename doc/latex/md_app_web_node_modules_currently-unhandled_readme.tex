Track the list of currently unhandled promise rejections. \end{quote}


\subsection*{Install}


\begin{DoxyCode}
$ npm install --save currently-unhandled
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Usage}


\begin{DoxyCode}
const currentlyUnhandled = require('currently-unhandled')(); // <- note the invocation

var fooError = new Error('foo');
var p = Promise.reject(new Error('foo'));

// on the next tick - unhandled rejected promise is added to the list:
currentlyUnhandled();
//=> [\{promise: p, reason: fooError\}]'

p.catch(() => \{\});

// on the next tick - handled promise is now removed from the list:
currentlyUnhandled();
//=> [];
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{A\+PI}

\subsubsection*{currently\+Unhandled()}

Returns an array of objects with {\ttfamily promise} and {\ttfamily reason} properties representing the rejected promises that currently do not have a rejection handler. The list grows and shrinks as unhandled\+Rejections are published, and later handled.

\subsection*{Browser Support}

This module can be bundled with {\ttfamily browserify}. At time of writing, it will work with native Promises in the Chrome browser only. For best cross-\/browser support, use {\ttfamily bluebird} instead of native Promise support in browsers.
